## Introduction

This guide will provide instructions on how to build and debug firmware for nRF52xx family of SoC-s on Windows, using VS Code and Ubuntu in WSL as a development environment.

Two boards are described:
* nRF52840-DK (PCA10056)
  * Has an on board Segger J-Link debug probe
  * Firmware loading and debugging via JTAG is described in the guide
  * Log output via RTT (JTAG) and UART is described in the guide
* nRF52840-DONGLE (PCA10059)
  * No on board debug probe
  * Firmware loading via serial DFU bootloader is described in the guide
  * Log output via UART is described in the guide


## Enable WSL and install Ubuntu

WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) first needs to be enabled in Windows.
Open PowerShell as an admin and run:

	dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all

Then, install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (or whatever is current) from the Windows store.
Run Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and enter root user name and password for the first time.

After that run (in WSL terminal):

	sudo apt update
	sudo apt upgrade


## Get GNU make and C compiler

Then install gnu make and C compiler (run in WSL terminal): 

	sudo apt install make
	sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
	sudo apt install gdb-multiarch
	sudo apt install unzip

Since current GCC comes without GDB and the debug extension in VS code expects to find it there, let's create a symbolic link to gdb-multiarch:
	
	sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gdb-multiarch /usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gdb 


## Get the Nordic SDK

Prepare a directory to put everything in (run in WSL terminal):

	cd ~
	mkdir src
	cd src

Next, go to the SDK download page (in Windows):

	https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Software/nRF5-SDK/Download#infotabs

Select latest v17 SDK (this is written using v17.0.2) and download it.
Copy *DeviceDownload.zip* to e.g. *C:\Projects*
Copy from Windows to ~/src in WSL and unpack (run this from WSL terminal): 

	cp /mnt/c/Projects/DeviceDownload/nRF5SDK1702d674dde.zip ~/src
	unzip nRF5SDK1702d674dde.zip
	rm nRF5SDK1702d674dde.zip


## Install VS code

Install VS code in Windows.

Install C/C++ extension.

Install Remote - WSL extension.

Install Cortex debug extension.

Restart the computer.


## Configure the SDK

Now the SDK needs to know where the compiler is. So, run this from the WSL terminal:

	which arm-none-eabi-gcc

You will get something like this:

	/usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc

Then open the SDK config file by running this in the WSL terminal: 

	code ~/src/nRF5_SDK_17.0.2_d674dde/components/toolchain/gcc/Makefile.posix

File will open in VS code. Change lines according to output from *which*:

	GNU_INSTALL_ROOT ?= /usr/bin/
	GNU_VERSION ?= 9.3.1
	GNU_PREFIX ?= arm-none-eabi


## Copy an example from the SDK

Make a sub directory for nRF examples:

	cd ~/src
	mkdir nrf_ble
	cd nrf_ble

It's a good practice to make a copy of nRF examples and not to change the ones in the SDK in case we need them later in their original condition.
Copy the BLE beacon example from the SDK (run in WSL terminal):

	cp ../nRF5_SDK_17.0.2_d674dde/examples/ble_peripheral/ble_app_beacon ./ -R

Open the example (run in WSL terminal):

	cd ble_app_beacon
	code .

VS code server will get installed into WSL when doing this for the first time.

Since the example was moved, it's path to the SDK root needs to be updated.
Go to file *pca10056/s140/armgcc/Makefile* in VS code and change line:
	
	SDK_ROOT := ../../../../../..

to:
	
	SDK_ROOT := ../../../../../nRF5_SDK_17.0.2_d674dde

This updates the example only for the armgcc environment. The examples also include support for IAR and Segger Embedded studio. These will not be taken into account and updated here.


## Building the example 

Press Ctrl+` to open VS code internal terminalâ€š and input the following:

	cd ~/src/nrf_ble/ble_app_beacon/pca10056/s140/armgcc
	make

This builds the example for the *nRF52840-DK (PCA10056)* board. In order to build for the *nRF52840-DONGLE (PCA10059)*, a separate target needs to be created by copying the one for PCA10056

	cd ~/src/nrf_ble/ble_app_beacon
	cp pca10056 pca10059 -r

After that, the board id needs to be changed from:

	CFLAGS += -DBOARD_PCA10056

to:

	CFLAGS += -DBOARD_PCA10059

Open the file in VS code to do that:

	code ~/src/nrf_ble/ble_app_beacon/pca10059/s140/armgcc/Makefile


## Seting up the debugger

Debugging will only work on *nRF52840-DK (PCA10056)*. It can also work on *nRF52840-DONGLE (PCA10059)* but not out of the box. An external J-Link probe needs to be connected to it. This will not be covered here.

Download and install Segger JLink  from:

	https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/JLink_Windows_V686f.exe

Now create the VS code config file for debugging:

	cd ~/src/nrf_ble/ble_app_beacon
	mkdir .vscode
	cd .vscode
	touch launch.json
	code launch.json

An empty config file will open. Now paste this:

	{
		// Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
		// Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
		// For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
		"version": "0.2.0",
		"configurations": [
		{
			"type": "cortex-debug",
			"request": "launch",
			"name": "Debug J-Link",
			"cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
			"executable": "${workspaceRoot}/pca10056/s140/armgcc/_build/nrf52840_xxaa.out",
			"serverpath": "/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/SEGGER/JLink/JLinkGDBServerCL.exe", 
			"servertype": "jlink",
			"device": "nRF52840_xxAA",
			"interface": "swd",
			"runToMain": true,
			"armToolchainPath": "/usr/bin/",
			"svdFile": "${workspaceRoot}/../nRF5_SDK_17.0.0_9d13099/modules/nrfx/mdk/nrf52840.svd" 
	}
		]
		}

This file defines all that is needed for the *Cortex debug* extension to work.

*executable* must point to the firmware ELF file.

*serverpath* must point to the J-Link GDB server. Note how it points to the Windows executable.

*svdFile* points to the CMSIS-SVD file that describes programmer's view of the targer microcontroller (register names and contents among other things).

Starting the execution will flash the firmware via JTAG and start the debugging session.


## Loading using serial DFU bootloader

*nRF52840-DONGLE (PCA10059)* cannot be loaded via JTAG out of the box but it can be loaded via the serial DFU bootloader.

The bootloader can be started by plugging the dongle into an PC USB port and pressing the *RESET* button (it's the sideways pointed one!). The board will appear as an USB COM port in Windows Device Manager. Take a note of its port number.

For flashing, we will need the *nrfutil* package that is provided by Nordic. 
It's installed via Python pip, in WSL:

	sudo apt install python3-pip
	pip3 install nrfutil
	source ~/.profile

Now we can add a target into the Makefile, to simplify DFU package generation.
Add target to Makefile (~/src/nrf_ble/ble_app_beacon/pca10059/s140/armgcc/Makefile):

	dfu: default
		nrfutil pkg generate --hw-version 52 --sd-req 0x00 --application-version-string 1.0.0 --application _build/nrf52840_xxaa.hex --softdevice $(SDK_ROOT)/components/softdevice/s140/hex/s140_nrf52_7.2.0_softdevice.hex --sd-id 0x0100 app_dfu_package.zip

This make target will produce a DFU package that contains all information needed to flash the firmware via serial DFU bootloader. This package contains the firmware that was just built and a SoftDevice HEX file.
The SoftDevice is a pre-compiled BLE stack that is provided by Nordic.
If the firmware uses BLE functionality a SoftDevice needs to be present in the flash memory along with the firmware itself.

The *--sd-id* flag defines which SoftDevice version is to be packaged in the DFU package and the *--softdevice* flag defines where to find it.

The *--sd-req* flag defines which SoftDevice needs to be present before loading in order for the DFU package to be accepted by the bootloader. This is neccessary in case when only the firmware image is loaded and it depends on a SoftDevice to be already present in the flash. This is not the case here since we are packaging the SoftDevice along with the firmware. Therefore *--sd-req* is 0x00, i.e. no SoftDevice needs to be present in order to flash this DFU package. 

Now invoke make dfu:

	make dfu

Find the USB serial device in Windows device manager and mark its port  number.
Then run the following command (e.g. */dev/ttyS5* is for COM5):
	
	nrfutil dfu serial -pkg app_dfu_package.zip -p /dev/ttyS5 -b 115200

After a while the firmware and SoftDevice are loaded and the board resets.


## Enable logging

To enable logging, some symbolic constants need to be defined/changed, depending on the example. All of the config constants are located here:

	ble_app_beacon/pca10056/s140/config/sdk_config.h	

Since Nordic created quite a mess of it all by not having a standardized *sdk_config.h* for all examples it can be non-trivial to try and transfer some configuration from one example to the other. 
A bit easier approach is to have a separate *app_config.h* file that can override parts of the configuration from *sdk_config.h*

To use it add the following define to the Makefile (ble_app_beacon/pca10056/s140/armgcc/Makefile)

	CFLAGS += -DUSE_APP_CONFIG

Then create an ble_app_beacon/pca10056/s140/config/app_config.h file:

	#ifndef APP_CONFIG_H
	#define APP_CONFIG_H
